## Disclaimer
The initial approach was to use `datasource` routes to fetch filter options but, CORS issues were encountered when attempting to bring the data from the endpoints:

- `http://3.136.147.85:8088/api/v1/datasource/table/10/column/city/value`

- `http://3.136.147.85:8088/api/v1/datasource/table/10/column/country/values/`

Some solutions were attempted, including using a CORS browser extension and setting up a proxy in the application. However, the issue likely originates from the API itself. 
As a workaround, mocked data was used for the city, country, and year filters.
